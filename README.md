## Known Limitations:

- The game's save path is hardcoded for Windows and may not work if the game changes its save directory structure in the future.

## Antivirus Information:

Some antivirus software might flag the `.exe` as potentially harmful because it bundles a Python interpreter. This is a known issue with executables generated by tools like `PyInstaller`. If you encounter such warnings, you can safely ignore them or add an exception in your antivirus software. However, always ensure you're downloading the executable directly from this official GitHub repository to avoid malicious versions.
